Just like a star across my sky, Just like an angel off the page, You have appeared to my life, Feel like I'll never be the same, Just like a song in my heart, Just like oil on my hands, Honour to love you Still I wonder why it is, I don't argue like this, With anyone but you, We do it all the time, Blowing out my mind, You've got this look I can't describe, You make me feel like I'm alive, When everything else is au fait, Without a doubt you're on my side, Heaven has been away too long, Can't find the words to write this song, Oh... Your love, Still I wonder why it is, I don't argue like this, With anyone but you, We do it all the time, Blowing out my mind, Now I have come to understand, The way it is, It's not a secret anymore, 'cause we've been through that before, From tonight I know that you're the only one, I've been confused and in the dark, Now I understand, I wonder why it is, I don't argue like this, With anyone but you, I wonder why it is, I wont let my guard down, For anyone but you We do it all the time, Blowing out my mind, Just like a star across my sky, Just like an angel off the page, You have appeared to my life, Feel like I'll never be the same, Just like a song in my heart, Just like oil on my hands<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRfKFJRNMDk">Like a star by Corrine Bailey Rae </a>
